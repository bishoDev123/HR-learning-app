# HR-learning-app
this is just a learning app where it shows my progress in my first full backend app, 
where I try to understand the inner workings of backend with php and mySQL,
by building an HR-like app where you input the username and password to login to your employee profile that should show data (that data is unkown for now). 
this app will be further expanded upon by connecting the mySQL database and who knows, maybe even to a real world server.
